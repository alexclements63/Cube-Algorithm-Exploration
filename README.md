### **Cubing Times**

1. **Pyraminx Duo**
     
   As of February 13th, I *can* solve it and I use the advanced method, as explained in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Zt7GEyYuE  
   This method allows me to solve the cube with only 4 moves, and is thus highly effective. 
   
   ###### Times for the Pyraminx Duo on February 13th
   
   **ao5** = 3.20s  
   **ao12** = 4.63s  
   **ao25** = 5.60s  
   
   ###### February 14th
   
   **ao5** = 3.06s
   **ao12** = 3.15s
   
   ###### February 18th
   
   **ao5** = 3.01s
   **ao12** = 3.07s

   ###### February 19th
   
   **ao5** = 3.15s
   **ao12** = 3.35s
   
   ###### February 20th
   
   **ao5** = 3.01s
   **ao12** = 3.20s  
         
2. **Pyraminx**

   As of February 18th, I *can't* solve the pyraminx as I've never tried.
   The method I used is the beginner method, as explained best in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSvbXmU4aHM
   
   *Note: These times are listed as Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds*
   
   ###### First Recorded Times for the Pyraminx from February 18th to 20th
   
   These were the times while I was first learning exactly how to solve the pyraminx. 
   As a result, the actual results are quite high, and were recorded across a few days.  
   
   **ao5** = 5:59:31    
   **ao12** = 6:32:61     
   **ao25** = 7:26:06    

   ###### February 21st  
   
   These results were recorded after I finished with the first set of averages.  
   
   **ao5** = 5:15:84   
   **ao12** = 5:30:21    

   ###### February 24th   
   
   **ao5** = 4:36:68    
   **ao12** = 4:40:23   
   
   ###### February 25th  
    
   **ao5** = 3:59:32   
   **ao12** = 4:37:63  
   
   ###### February 26th   
   
   On the last possible day I could practice with the pyraminx, I saw a great increase in my solving time.   
   I did look at another resource to get assistance, but I didn't expect this big of a difference.    
   
   **ao5** = 0:57:95  
   **ao12** = 1:10:32

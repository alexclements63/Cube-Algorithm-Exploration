### **Cubing Times**

1. Pyraminx Duo
     
   As of February 13th, I *can* solve it and I use the advanced method, as explained in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Zt7GEyYuE
   This method allows me to solve the cube with only 4 moves, and is thus highly effective. 
   
   ###### Times for the Pyraminx Duo on February 13th
   
   **ao5** = 3.20s  
   **ao12** = 4.63s  
   **ao25** = 5.60s  
   
   ###### February 14th
   
   **ao5** = 3.06s
   **ao12** = 3.15s
   
   ###### February 18th
   
   **ao5** = 3.01s
   **ao12** = 3.07s

   ###### February 19th
   
   **ao5** = 3.15s
   **ao12** = 3.35s
   
   ###### February 20th
   
   **ao5** = 3.01s
   **ao12** = 3.20s

2. Pyraminx

   As of February 18th, I *can't* solve the pyraminx as I've never tried.
   The method I will use is **ADD THIS**/
   
   ###### Times for the Pyraminx
   
   **ao5** =    
   **ao12** =      
   **ao25** =
